## Guide to this repository
 
There are three directories of interest in this repo:

- `docs/`:  the source code for the course web site
- `homework/`: the materials for the homework sets
- `lectures/`: the source code for the lecture slides

The `lectures/` directory may be of particular interest because it gives you access to the R code that is used during lectures.
