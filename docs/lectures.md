We are making the lecture slides (`*.html`), notes for you to bring to class to annotate (`*.pdf`), and the sources code (`lectures/week*`) available.

Week | HTML Slides | Notes | Source
-----|-------------| ----- | ----------
1 | [week1.html]() | [week1_notes.pdf]() | [lectures/week1]()


The materials from the lecture slides will also be included in book format at https://jdstorey.github.io/asdsbook/.
