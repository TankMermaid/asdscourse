We are making the lecture slides (`*.html`) available, as well as notes for you to bring to class to annotate (`*.pdf`).  All source code for the lecture materials is available at the repository [https://github.com/jdstorey/asdslectures](https://github.com/jdstorey/asdslectures).  Note that the links for the items below will point to this page until the material is posted.
